# Ford GoBike System Data
###    by Joel Minier-Matar


## Dataset

> The ford wheels dataset contains information about bicycle rides for subscribers and customer. The set has the duration for each ride as well as the starting and ending stations. For this study we will be looking at the Ford GoBike system data for a full year from the beginning of April 2019 to the end of March 2020, over 2 million records will be analyzed to identify trends and patterns on the system users. The original data files can be found at: https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration phase, I found that most of the rides starts at peak hours (7-10 am) and (4-7 pm) during weekdays but not on weekends. I also noticed that most of the user rent bikes using the app instead of the clipper. I identified the top 10 stations and explored the number of rides starting and ending in the most popular station. I also checked the monthly trends and I noticed lower rides in December, possible due to the Christmas holidays; and in March 2020 probably due to the COVID-19 lock-down.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the explanatory analysis, I focused on the type of users taking the rides and their patterns at different times of the day as well as on the different days of the week. During weekdays, most of the rides are in peak hours (7-10 am and 4-6 pm), while in weekends the rides are mainly in the afternoon. I also observed that weekdays rides are mainly done by subscriber while on weekend the proportion of subscribers and customers are close to each other.
